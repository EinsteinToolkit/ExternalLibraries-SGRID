1. Purpose

Distribute the SGRID library that can be used to read binary neutron
star initial data produced by SGRID.


2. What it can do

In order to use SGRID's initial data in Cactus, we need to interpolate from
SGRID's grid to the grid points that Cactus is using. The SGRID library
distributed here, contains functions that can perform interpolation onto
arbitrary points. Note however, that one also needs the Cactus thorn DNSdata
to actually read initial data. The DNSdata thorn will use functions inside
the SGRID library to set up initial data for Cactus.
