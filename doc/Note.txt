# Updating the sgrid version:
# ---------------------------
# The dir dist contains a tar file sgrid_<old hash>.tar (e.g.
# sgrid_a4fe199d.tar), which contains the source for the sgrid library. To
# update this tar file to a newer sgrid version, follow these steps:

# 1. make a new tar file:
git clone https://github.com/sgridsource/sgrid.git
cd sgrid
make tar_DNSlibsgrid
cd ..
# This results in a new tar file: sgrid_<new-hash>.tar

# 2. Copy the new tar file over the old tar file in
# ExternalLibraries-SGRID/dist.
cp sgrid_<new-hash>.tar ExternalLibraries-SGRID/dist/sgrid_<old hash>.tar
cd ExternalLibraries-SGRID/dist
git commit

# 3. Update the name of the old tar file to the new name:
# 3.a) rename the tar file
git mv sgrid_<old hash>.tar sgrid_<new hash>.tar
cd ..
# 3.b) Update NAME_SUFFIX is src/build.sh by replacing the line
NAME_SUFFIX=_<old hash>
# with
NAME_SUFFIX=_<new hash>
# 3.c) Commit the name change and push it into the repo
git commit
git push
